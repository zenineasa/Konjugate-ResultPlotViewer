// Building a .kja proves the files exist; it doesn't prove they resolve at runtime -- a vendored
// ES module can import a sibling file that never got vendored, and nothing about a successful build
// or a correct file listing would catch that (exactly what happened to the sibling
// Konjugate-PoseVisualizer repo: three.module.js's own `import ... from './three.core.js'` silently
// broke once three.core.js wasn't vendored alongside it, and the add-on rendered nothing with no
// visible error). This statically checks every relative import in a built .js/.mjs file, and every
// relative <script src>/<link href> in a built .html file, resolves to another file actually present
// in the same archive -- no browser needed.
